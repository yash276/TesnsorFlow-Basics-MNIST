2. DATA ----> It contains the MNIST Dataset.The **ZIP** file contains the complete Dataset for MNIST i.e. 60,000 Training Images and 10000 Test Images<br/>
The **Training** folder has only 10000 images and The **Testing** folder has 100 images only. This due to my system memory constraint while training.<br/> 
You can increase and decrease the data.<br/><br/>
